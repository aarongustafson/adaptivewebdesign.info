<p>As would be expected from a former manager of the <a href="http://webstandards.org">Web Standards Project</a>, <strong>Aaron Gustafson</strong> is passionate about web standards and accessibility.</p>

<p>In his nearly two decades working on the Web, Aaron has worked with a number of companies you’ve probably heard of including Box, Happy Cog, Major League Baseball, McAfee, <em>the New York Times</em>, SAS, StubHub, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Vanguard, Walgreens, and Yahoo. He joined <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> as a web standards advocate to work closely with their browser team.</p>

<p>Aaron loves to share his knowledge and insights in written form. His <a href="http://alistapart.com/author/agustafson">three-part series on progressive enhancement for <em>A List Apart</em></a> is a perennial favorite and his seminal book on the subject, <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.com"><em>Adaptive Web Design</em></a>, has earned him numerous accolades and honors. When he’s not writing, Aaron is frequently on the road <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/aarongustafson/">presenting at conferences and running workshops</a> across the globe.</p>

<p>Back home in Chattanooga, TN, Aaron is the proprietor of the <a href="http://chadevicelab.org">Chattanooga Open Device Lab</a> and helps organize the <a href="http://codeandcreativity.com">Code &amp; Creativity</a> talk series with his partner <a href="https://twitter.com/ShirleyTemper">Kelly McCarthy</a>. He is a longtime member of <a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/experts/aaron-gustafson/">Rosenfeld Media’s “experts” group</a> and writes about whatever’s on his mind at <a href="http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/">aaron-gustafson.com</a>.</p>
