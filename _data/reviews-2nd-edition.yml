  review: "<p>Sometimes second editions are relatively minor updates to a prior version of a book. In the case of <em>Adaptive Web Design</em>, I wouldn’t have been upset if that was the case. After all, the first edition was <em>exceptionally</em> well written and provided as clear an explanation of progressive enhancement as you could possibly hope for.</p><p>But the second edition of <em>Adaptive Web Design</em> isn’t just a minor update—it’s a completely new take on the topic. While I would have been hard pressed to imagine it happening, Aaron somehow managed to write an even better guide to progressive enhancement.</p><p>You see, being told a specific way to code—a specific technique or snippet—that can have some short term value. But what’s more important is thinking about the underlying philosophy and the values that guide those decisions. While techniques come and go, those guiding principles persist. Understanding them at a deep level will help guide you as things change, helping you to make appropriate decisions about how to wield new technology as it emerges.</p><p>That’s what Aaron provides here. While there are some specific examples of how you could layer enhancements onto your site, most of the book is focused on helping you understand the underlying principles of progressive enhancement—principles that will help guide your decisions long after you’ve read about them.</p><p>I contributed an early quote about the book after I read it through which sums up my thoughts much more concisely than these last few paragraphs:</p><blockquote><p><em>Adaptive Web Design</em> should be one of the first books on the shelf of anyone building for the web. Showing a deep understanding of the web, Aaron manages to cram nearly 20 years of insight into a book that is an absolute pleasure to read. I dare you to try and read this book without a highlighter handy.</p></blockquote><p>The book isn’t out until early December, and you should absolute pick up a copy when it’s available. I can’t recommend it highly enough.</p>"

  review: "At the outset of Adaptive Web Design, Aaron makes it clear that this will not be a technical book so much as a philosophical one. This is a bold move given the industry's neophilia for skills and technologies, but sets the book apart from the mere manuals that are the majority of its counterparts. What follows is paean to creating for the Web in a way that works with it, not despite it; a holistic approach that takes in performance, accessibility, usability and standards. It's rich with anecdotes, humour and insight from an author with impressive experience in the field and is not short on applicable techniques. But while so many web design books speak to me as an engineer, a coder or someone just looking to understand the latest trend, this book speaks to me as a designer and as a grown-up. That is most welcome."
