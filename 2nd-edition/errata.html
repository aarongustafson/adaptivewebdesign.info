<p>Sometimes we screw up, sometimes things change. Regardless, books sometimes contain errors. Below are notes on these from the Second Edition of <cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite>.</p>

{% for errata in site.data.errata-2nd-edition %}

	{% if forloop.first %}
		<ul class="errata">
	{% endif %}

	{% include errata.html %}

	{% if forloop.last %}
		</ul>
	{% endif %}

{% else %}
	<p>No errata has been discoveredâ€¦ yet.</p>
{% endfor %}
